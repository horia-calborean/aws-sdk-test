# aws-sdk-test
Place to test how to work with AWS SDK 2.0 from java

These were just some tests, there is no plan to make them look right.

Start with the "comprehend" package if you want to understand the examples.

The textract package plays with both S3 and Terxtract services from AWS.

Make sure to change the value of name in AWSProfile to mach the profile you want to use from .aws/credentials

Hope this helps :)
